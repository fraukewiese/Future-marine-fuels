In this study, three alternatives complying with the ECA regulations for sulphur as well as Tier III for NOX are presented and compared using life cycle assessment. None of the three alternatives will significantly reduce the life cycle impact on climate change compared to heavy fuel oil (HFO). However, all alternatives will reduce the impact on particulate matter, photochemical ozone formation, acidification and terrestrial eutrophication potential. The assessment also highlighted two important regulatory aspects. Firstly, the need to regulate the ammonia slip from use of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and secondly the need to regulate the methane slip from LNG engines. In addition, an analysis of the use of SCR in Swedish waters is presented showing that SCRs have been used on a number of ships already giving significantly reduced NOX emissions.},

abstract = {Electrofuels (also called power-to-gas/liquids/fuels or synthetic fuels) are potential future carbon-based fuels produced from carbon dioxide (CO2) and water using electricity as the primary source of energy. This article assesses the production cost of electrofuels through: (i) a literature review, focusing on which steps that have the largest impact as well as the greatest uncertainty; (ii) a more comprehensive review, including the costs and efficiencies for the separate production steps, and (iii) calculations to compare the production costs of the different fuel options in a harmonized way, including a sensitivity analysis of the parameters with the greatest impact on the total electrofuel production cost. The assessment covers: methane, methanol, dimethyl ether, diesel, and gasoline. The literature review showed large differences among the studies and a broad range of production cost estimates (10–3500 €2015/MWhfuel), which is first and foremost as a result of how authors have handled technology matureness, installation costs, and external factors. Our calculations result in productions costs in the range of 200–280 €2015/MWhfuelin 2015 and 160–210 €2015/MWhfuelin 2030 using base cost assumptions from the literature review. Compared to biofuels, these estimates are in the upper range or above. Our results also show that the choice of energy carrier is not as critical for the electrofuels production cost as technological choices and external factors. Instead the two most important factors affecting the production cost of all electrofuels are the capital cost of the electrolyser and the electricity price, i.e., the hydrogen production cost. The capacity factor of the unit and the life span of the electrolyser are also important parameters affecting that production cost. In order to determine if electrofuels are a cost-effective future transport fuel relative to alternatives other than biofuels, the costs for distribution, propulsion, and storage systems need to be considered.},

abstract = {Ammonia production with offshore wind power has the potential to transform energy and fertilizer markets within the United States. As summarized in this paper, the offshore wind resource can be converted directly into liquid ammonia using state-of-the-art technologies. The liquid ammonia can either be used as a fertilizer or a fuel. This work reviews the technologies required for all-electric, wind-powered ammonia production and offers a general design of such a system. Cost models based on the physical equipment necessary to produce ammonia with wind power are developed; offshore wind farm cost models are also developed for near-shore, shallow, wind farms in the United States. These models are capable of calculating the capital costs of small, industrial-sized ammonia plants coupled with an offshore wind farm. A case study for a utility-connected, all-electric ammonia plant in the Gulf of Maine is used to assess the lifetime economics of such a system. The results show that significant utility grid backup is required for an all-electric ammonia plant built with present-day technologies. A sensitivity analysis showed that the total levelized cost of ammonia is driven in large part by the cost of producing electricity with offshore wind.},

abstract = {Three responses that reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions in maritime transport are slower speeds, larger vessels and slender hull designs. We use crude oil carriers as our illustrative example; these represent nearly a quarter of international sea cargo movements. We estimate the potential and costs in these which can all be described as capital substituting for energy and emissions. At different degrees of flexibility and time scales: speed reductions are feasible immediately when there are vessels available, though more capital will be tied up in cargo. Deployment of larger and more slender vessels to a greater extent requires fleet renovation, and also investments in ports and infrastructure. A novel finding in our analysis is that if bunker costs rise as a result of emission costs (fees, quotas), then this may depress speeds and emissions more than if they result from higher oil prices. The reason is that for higher oil prices, more capital tied up in cargo may give cargo owners an interest in speeding up, partly counteracting the impulse from fuel costs that tends to slow vessels down. Emission costs, in contrast, do not raise cargo values.},

abstract = {Growing concerns about anthropogenic climate change and its effects on the environment have encouraged significant recent developments towards decarbonizing the energy system. Developments in transportation technology, such as vehicle electrification, can result in significant CO2, particulate matter, and SOx reductions over the lifetime of a vehicle. The shipping industry alone accounted for 2.1{\%} of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2012, however, due to energy requirements and weight restrictions, batteries and direct electrification cannot be used to mitigate emissions. Synthetic fuels, as an indirect electrification option, are a viable solution to achieve emission reduction goals. The purpose of this study is to determine the most cost effective combination of synthetic fuels and fuel cells or internal combustion engines to replace fossil oil as the main propulsion fuel in the shipping industry in 2030 and 2040. The fuels, namely RE-FT-Diesel, RE-LNG, RE-LH2 and RE-MeOH, are analysed for both an internal combustion engine and a fuel cell. The scenarios were analysed by comparing the levelised cost of mobility (LCOM). The LCOM was composed of 5 different facets including the capex of the engines/fuel cells and the tanks, the opex of the engines/fuel cells, the cost of lost cargo space, fuel cost and the CO2 cost. The final unit of comparison was €/1000DWT-km. It was determined that hydrogen fuel cells were the most likely to replace fossil internal combustion engines if the fuel cells follow their expected development. Significant gains in fuel cell average efficiency and decreases in production cost between today and 2030 and 2040 are factors contributing to the competitiveness. A CO2 cost was set to 61 €/tCO2 in 2030 and 75 €/tCO2 in 2040. Most of the other technology combinations are close to competing with fossil diesel with a CO2 price in 2040; however, hydrogen fuel cells are close to competing with fossil fuel without a CO2 cost in 2040.},

For the sector to reduce its emissions in line with climate change objectives, a wholesale transition is required from the current carbon intensive shipping system to one with a lower climatic impact. Drawing on the multi-level perspective from the socio-technical transitions literature, this paper focuses on two technological developments which could reduce the emissions from shipping – slow steaming and wind propulsion. Outlining the landscape changes which may hinder or support the incorporation of each of these innovations into the broader shipping regime the paper shows how slow steaming has been accommodated within this regime, in response to high oil prices and the economic downturn. In the longer term it concludes that additional policy measures may be required to ensure slow steaming persists should landscape pressures reduce. Oil prices, and the environmental agenda, are driving the development of wind propulsion, but more needs to be done to support those companies which seek to demonstrate and commercialise modern incarnations of the original pioneers of the seas.},

abstract = {This paper provides new knowledge about the life-cycle emissions of natural gas compared to traditional petroleum-based fuels in the marine sector. While natural gas will reduce local air pollutants, such as sulfur oxides and particulate matter, the implications for greenhouse gases depend on how the natural gas is extracted, processed, distributed, and used. Applying a “technology warming potential” (TWP) approach, natural gas as a marine fuel achieves climate parity within 30 years for diesel ignited engines, though could take up to 190 years to reach climate parity with conventional fuels in a spark ignited engine. Movement towards natural gas as a marine fuel continues to progress, and conditions exist in some regions to make a near-term transition to natural gas feasible. Liquefied natural gas in marine transportation is likely to be incentivized where economics favoring natural gas is coupled with air emissions public policy targets. To ensure that climate neutral conversion is achieved with the least delay, TWP results highlight the important role of energy policy for infrastructure development of upstream pathways and onboard ship systems technology innovation.},

These vessels are specially designed to provide services to oil and gas operations, such as anchor handling, supply and subsea operations. They have multiple engines and advanced dynamic positioning systems to ensure that they can perform their duties with high reliability at nearly any sea state. Combined with high safety requirements, this has resulted in general operational patterns with vessels running multiple combustion engines even at calm water conditions. For emissions, low engine loads yield high emissions of exhaust gases such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and aerosols such as black carbon (BC), due to less favorable combustion conditions. The high span for these vessels between low loads and high, and their great need for potential power at short notice, motivate our examination of hybrid setups with electric: the vessel segment should be more favorable than many. We find that combining batteries with combustion engines reduces local pollution and climate impact, while the economics with current battery cost and fuel prices is good enough for new vessels, but not good enough for retrofits.},

This study aims at quantifying potential reductions of ships' emissions of GHG from efforts implemented by ports. Building on a model that calculates GHG emissions from ships in various scenarios for individual ports, different kinds of measures for emission reductions are investigated for diverse types of vessels and parts of the port area. A case study of the ship traffic to the Port of Gothenburg is performed. Projections of ship emissions in the port area for 2030 are made, and three scenarios, ‘1. Alternative fuel', ‘2. Ship design' and ‘3. Operation', are analysed. These scenarios are related to a business as usual development. GHG emissions from ships in the port are projected to increase by 40{\%} to 2030 in a business as usual (BAU) scenario. The highest reductions were seen in the ‘Operation' scenario where GHG emissions were 10{\%} lower than the BAU level.},

abstract = {The combined effort of reducing the emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and greenhouse gases to comply with future regulations and reduce impact on climate change will require a significant change in ship propulsion. One alternative is to change fuels. In this study we compare the life cycle environmental performance of liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied biogas (LBG), methanol and bio-methanol. We also highlight a number of important aspects to consider when selecting marine fuels. A transition to use of LNG or methanol produced from natural gas would significantly improve the overall environmental performance. However, the impact on climate change is of the same order of magnitude as with use of heavy fuel oil. It is only the use of LBG and bio-methanol that has the potential to reduce the climate impact. The analysis did not show any significant differences in environmental performance between methane and methanol when produced from the same raw materials, but the performance of the methanol engines are yet to be validated.},

abstract = {Ship-source greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could increase by up to 250{\%} by 2050 from their 2012 levels, owing to increasing global freight volumes. Binding international legal agreements to regulate GHGs, however, are lacking as technical solutions remain expensive, and crucial industrial support is absent. In 2003, the International Maritime Organization adopted Resolution A.963 (23) to regulate shipping CO2emissions via technical, operational, and market-based routes. However, progress has been slow and uncertain; there is no concrete emission reduction target or definitive action plan. Yet, a full-fledged roadmap may not even emerge until 2023. In this policy analysis, we revisit the progress of technical, operational, and market-based routes and the associated controversies. We argue that 1) a performance-based index, though good-intentioned, has loopholes affecting meaningful CO2emission reductions driven by technical advancements; 2) using slow steaming to cut energy consumption stands out among all operational solutions thanks to its immediate and obvious results, but with the already slow speed in practice, this single source has limited emission reduction potential; 3) without a technology-savvy shipping industry, a market-based approach is essentially needed to address the environmental impact. To give shipping a 50:50 chance for contributing fairly and proportionately to keep global warming below 2 °C, deep emission reductions should occur soon.},

abstract = {This paper assesses the effects of a global emissions trading scheme (GETS) for international aviation and shipping as a way of reducing emissions of both greenhouse gases (GHG) and other atmospheric emissions that lead to air pollution. A prior assessment of such integration requires the coupling of energy–environment–economy (E3) global modelling of mitigation policies with the atmospheric modelling of pollution sources, mixing and deposition. We report the methodology and results of coupling of the E3MG model and the global atmospheric model, p-TOMCAT. We assess the effects of GETS on the concentrations of atmospheric gases and on the radiative forcing, comparing a GETS scenario to a reference BASE scenario with higher use of fossil fuels. The paper assesses the outcome of GETS for atmospheric composition and radiative forcing for 2050. GETS on international shipping and aviation reduces their CO2 and non-CO2 emissions up to 65{\%}. As a consequence atmospheric concentrations are modified and the radiative forcing due to international transport is reduced by different amounts as a function of the pollutant studied (15{\%} for CO2, 35{\%} for methane and up to 50{\%} for ozone).},

abstract = {International shipping carries around 80 per cent of global trade by volume and over 70 per cent by value. However, there is concern that the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping lead to adverse effects on climate, human health and marine ecosystems. Currently the international climate change regime under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process and the IMO through its Marine Environment Protection Committee are grappling with this issue, and GHG emissions from international shipping have been partially regulated by amendments to Annex VI to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78) in 2011 and 2014. These amendments aim to reduce GHG emissions from international shipping by means of technical and operational measures. However, research indicates that the adopted technical and operational measures alone would not achieve absolute emissions reduction due to projected growth of international seaborne trade. Currently it is still controversial whether it is time to consider market-based measures (MBMs) in furthering the reduction of shipping GHG emissions. This article examines whether it is necessary to adopt MBMs, proposes a preferred MBM, and suggests that a MBM be considered in or after 2016.},

abstract = {The goal of this study is to evaluate the life cycle performance of two alternative pathways to biofuels in the shipping industry: the 'diesel route' and the 'gas route'. The diesel route comprises of a shift from heavy fuel oil to marine gas oil and then a gradual shift to biodiesel, whereas the gas route comprises of a shift to liquefied natural gas and then a gradual shift to liquefied biogas. The two routes are assessed in a case study for the ferry traffic between the Swedish mainland and the island Gotland. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate the environmental performance with the functional unit chosen to be one year of ro-pax ferry service, including both passenger and goods transportation. The gas route is indicated to have better overall environmental performance than the diesel route. Furthermore, use of biofuels is illustrated as one possible measure to decrease the global warming impact from shipping, but to the expense of greater environmental impact for some other impact categories. As an example, the global warming potential (GWP100) was shown to decrease with the use of biofuels in this study, while the eutrophication potential and the primary energy use increased. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Sea shipping is one of the most widespread transport modes. Therefore, the improvement of energy efficiency and further curbing of Carbon Dioxide emissions by marine vessels is important both economically and environmentally. During the sixty ninth Marine Environment Protection Committee session in April 2016, the International Maritime Organization approved mandatory requirements for ships to report their fuel consumption, which is the first of the three-phase approach to derive a standardized measure for energy efficiency tracking of marine vessels. Under the International Maritime Organization Data Collection System, emphasis has been placed on verification of the collected fuel consumption data so that vessels' energy efficiency could be benchmarked and improved. To optimize the operational efficiency of marine vessels, this paper proposes the Real-Time Energy Efficiency Operating Index and the framework to implement it. The proposed scheme can be used to verify fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission data reported by individual ships. It also provides an approach to automatically and remotely estimate the transport work in real time. The proposed architecture mainly relies on the Automated Identification System and a constructed vessel database. A proof of concept prototype is deployed that monitors the energy efficiency of vessels along the Singapore Strait.},

abstract = {CO2 emissions from maritime transport represent around 3{\%} of total annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These emissions are assumed to increase by 150–250{\%} in 2050 in business-as-usual scenarios with a tripling of world trade, while achieving a 1.5–2 °C climate target requires net zero GHG emissions across all economic sectors. Consequentially, the maritime sector is facing the challenge to significantly reduce its GHG emissions as contribution to the international ambition to limit the effects of climate change. This article presents the results of a review of around 150 studies, to provide a comprehensive overview of the CO2 emissions reduction potentials and measures published in literature. It aims to identify the most promising areas, i.e. technologies and operational practices, and quantify the combined mitigation potential. Results show a significant variation in reported CO2 reduction potentials across reviewed studies. In addition, no single measure is sufficient to achieve meaningful GHG reductions. Emissions can be reduced by more than 75{\%}, based on current technologies and by 2050, through a combination of measures if policies and regulations are focused on achieving these reductions. In terms of emissions per freight unit transported, it is possible to reduce emissions by a factor of 4–6.},

abstract = {Squeezed between pressures of the economic downturn, the abundance of ships in certain sectors, and an avalanche of regional and international regulations aimed at reducing shipping's impact on climate change, some ship owners and managers have looked to innovate and seek opportunities to grow their influence in shipping markets. Under economic pressure, a number of ship owners turned to hot or cold lay-ups, scrapping unproductive tonnage, or simply getting out of the business. Others looked at the ever increasing cost of bunkers and decided to position themselves as more efficient operators with high quality services to offer. In this respect, some concerted optimisation efforts at Teekay directed in the areas of technical, commercial and operations have helped increase fleet utilization and profitability while ensuring safety and reliability of service. Some of the technical optimisation efforts include PBCF installation, CPP reprogramming, Fuel Slide valve upgrade, Alpha lubricator retrofit, Sonic cleaning of economizer, and cylinder oil consumption optimisation. Operational optimisation initiatives include Cargo heating management, Weather routing, Hull {\&} propeller performance monitoring, and Engine performance monitoring. Commercial optimisation includes development of tools that provide a better understanding of technical and operational limitations from a commercial standpoint. Initiatives like developing procedures for slow steaming operations and the creation of Speed vs. Fuel consumption matrix provide value-added input and technical insight. These tools support channelling efforts on allocation of the best positioned asset to a fixture and being able to select the speed and fuel consumption for both ballast and laden voyages in order to positively affect net voyage revenue. One salutary outcome of the economic downturn has been a sharp reduction in contribution of GHG emissions by shipping. With a revival in fortune of the shipping industry one can expect a corresponding increase in GHG contributions. But does that really need to be the case? Some of the lessons learned since 2009 have contributed significantly to low carbon shipping—like slow steaming. With a strategic alignment of stakeholders' interest to lessen shipping's impact on GHG emissions, these practices can continue to be used.},

The method proposes to calculate the amount of energy and exergy available for the WHR systems and to compare it with the propulsion and auxiliary power needs based on available data for ship operational profile. The expected exergy efficiency of the WHR system is used as an independent variable, thus allowing estimating the expected fuel savings when a detailed design of the WHR system is not yet available. The use of the proposed method can guide in the choice of the installation depending on the requirements of the owner in terms of payback time and capital investment.

The vehicles included in the evaluation are passenger cars, light-duty vehicles (LDVs), and heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) for road-transport applications, and a short-range passenger vessel for maritime transport applications. The results show that, compared to conventional fuels, in both transport applications and for all vehicle classes, the use of compressed and liquefied natural gas has a 15–27{\%} GHG emissions reduction effect per km travel. The effect becomes large, 81–211{\%}, when compressed and liquefied renewable natural gas are used instead. The results are sensitive to the type and source of feedstock used, the type of vehicle engine, assumed methane leakage and methane slip, and the allocated energy and environmental digestate credits, in each pathway. In maritime applications, the use of liquefied natural gas and renewable natural gas instead of low sulfur marine fuels results in a 60–100{\%} SOx and 90–96{\%} PM emissions reduction.

abstract = {There is a need for alternative fuels in the shipping sector for two main motivations: to deliver a reduction in local pollutants and comply with existing regulation; and to mitigate climate change and cut greenhouse gas emissions. However, any alternative fuel must meet a range of criteria to become a viable option. Key among them is the requirement that it can deliver emissions reductions over its full life-cycle. For a set of fuels, comprising both conventional and alternative fuels, together with associated production pathways, this paper presents a life-cycle assessment with respect to six emissions species: local pollutants sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter; and greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. While the analysis demonstrates that no widely available fuel exists currently to deliver on both motivations, some alternative fuel options have the potential, if key barriers can be overcome. Hydrogen or other synthetic fuels rely on decarbonisation of both energy input to production and other feedstock materials to deliver reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, bio-derived fuels can be an abatement option, but only if it can be ensured that land-use change whilst growing biomass does not impact wider potential savings and the sector is able to compete sufficiently for their use. These examples show that crucial barriers are located upstream in the respective fuel life-cycle and that the way to overcome them may reside beyond the scope of the shipping sector alone.},

@article{GILBERT2014,
abstract = {The shipping sector is required to reduce fuel sulphur content to 0.1{\%} in Emission Control Areas by 2015 and to 0.5{\%} globally by 2020. Although this is demanding, a greater challenge for all sectors is climate change. However, the three options to comply with sulphur regulation do little to address this challenge. With a deep-seated change to the type of fuel burnt in marine engines, this should be seen as an opportunity to explore co-benefits of sulphur and carbon reduction – instead of taking a short-sighted approach to the problem. It is argued here that the upcoming sulphur regulations should be postponed and instead, a co-ordinated suite of regulations should be implemented that tackles cumulative CO2 emissions and localised SOx emissions in chorus. This would ensure that less developed, yet more radical, step-change forms of propulsion such as wind, battery and biofuels are introduced from the outset – reducing the risks of infrastructure lock-in and preventing the lock-out of technologies that can meaningfully reduce absolute emissions from the sector.},
