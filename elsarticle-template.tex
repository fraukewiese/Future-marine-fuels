\subsection{Mathematical Formulation}
The future marine fuels problem is formulated mathematically as a linear and divisible model with the following equations. It is a stock model, initialised with data for the first time step that allows for investments in new technologies in the further course. The investment options are on the one hand forced and on the other limited by the model constraints. They are in general used to give credit to regularities and behaviour patterns that shape the system under investigation. Since the objective's sense is the minimisation of the overall system's costs \cref{eq:objective}, investments are interpreted as adverse but inevitable actions to cope with the constraint's demands, such as: Lowering CO$_2$e emissions to air, (over-)supplying the transport demand in each time-step or scrapping ships, when their lifetime is expired. The domains of all model variables are within non-negative real numbers, including zero $\left(R_{0}^{+}\right)$.

\subsubsection{Objective function}
\noindent The model's objective is the minimisation of the total system costs. It comprises the sum of all accumulated annual costs for fuel, infrastructure and ships. Asset costs account only with the annual added amounts and are multiplied with their respective lifetimes, since they are given to the model as annuities.
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        min. &\sum_{\forall t \in T}\sum_{\forall s \in S}\left( CF_{t, s} + CI_{t, s} + CS_{t, s} \right)\label{eq:objective}\\
        \intertext{s.t.}
        CF_{t, s} &\geq fa_{t,s} \cdot cf_{t,s}\\
        CI_{t, s} &\geq \left( faiup_{t,s} - fainit_{t, s} \right) \cdot li_{s} \cdot ci_{t,s}, \forall t \in T_0\\
        CI_{t, s} &\geq faiup_{t,s} \cdot li_{s} \cdot ci_{t,s}, \forall t \in T_{>0}\\
        CS_{t, s} &\geq \left( fasup_{t,s} - fainit_{t, s} \right) \cdot li_{s} \cdot ci_{t,s}, \forall t \in T_0\\
        CS_{t, s} &\geq fasup_{t,s} \cdot ls_{s} \cdot cs_{t,s}, \forall t \in T_{>0}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

\subsubsection{Fuel constraints}
\noindent The following fuel constraints refer to the amounts of fuel per ship type in each time step. Investments in infrastructure, new-build and refit ships consider exclusively the sum of the added capacities per ship or infrastructure over the respective lifetime. Ships and infrastructure are separated, due to different costs and lifetimes, even if they belong to the same technology.
\\
Infrastructure Capacity: Sum of all added infrastructure capacity within the respective proceeded technical lifetime.
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        faicap_{t,s} &\leq \sum_{\textbf{x}}^{t-1} \left( faiup_{x,s} \right), \forall t \in T_{>0}, \forall s \in S\label{eq:faicap}\\
        \intertext{s.t.}
        x &= T_0, \forall t \leq \left(li_{s} + T_0 - 1\right)\\
        x &= t - li_{s} + 1, \forall t > \left(li_{s} + T_0 - 1\right)
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
\par\noindent
Additional Infrastructure: Annual additional infrastructure capacity needed to supply the corresponding ship-types.
\begin{equation}
    faiup_{t,s} \geq fa_{t,s} - faicap_{t,s}, \forall t \in T_{>0}, \forall s \in S\label{eq:faiup}
\end{equation}
Ship Capacity: Sum of all added ships within the respective proceeded technical lifetime.
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        fascap_{t,s} &\leq \sum_{\textbf{x}}^{t-1} \left(fasup_{x,s} \right), \forall t \in T_{>0}, \forall s \in S\label{eq:fascap}\\
        \intertext{s.t.}
        x &= T_0, \forall t \leq \left(ls_{s} + T_0 - 1\right)\\
        x &= t - ls_{s} + 1, \forall t > \left(ls_{s} + T_0 - 1\right)
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Added Ships: Annual additional ship capacity needed to satisfy the transport demand.
\begin{equation}
    fasup_{t,s} \geq fa_{t,s} - fascap_{t,s}, \forall t \in T_{>0}, \forall s \in S\label{eq:fasup}
\end{equation}
Refit: Defines in each time-step the fuel amount available for refit by old ships.
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:refitships}
    \begin{align}
    fa_{t,s} + fa_{t,r} - fa_{T_0, s} &\leq 0, \forall t \in T_{<\left(T_0+ls_{s}\right)}, \forall s, r \in RO\\
    fa_{t,s} + fa_{t,r} & = 0, \forall t \in T_{\geq\left(T_0+ls_{s}\right)}, \forall s, r \in RO
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Bio-fuel: Limits the bio-fuel availability in each time step.
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{\forall s \in SB} \left(fa_{t,s} \right) - ba_{t} \leq 0, \forall t \in T\label{eq:biofuel}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Demand constraints}
\noindent Transport Demand: The transport supply of all ships must either be greater or equal to the transport demand in each time-step.
\begin{equation}
    tdtotal_t \leq \sum_{\forall s \in S} \left( fa_{t,s} \cdot ts_{t,s}\right), \forall t \in T \label{eq:td_total}
\end{equation}
Short Transport Demand: The amount of fuel available for short range ships is limited by the transport demand of that range.
\begin{equation}
    tdshort_t \geq \sum_{\forall s \in SR} \left( fa_{t,s} \cdot ts_{t,s}\right), \forall t \in T \label{eq:td_short}
\end{equation}
Non-SECAs Transport Demand: The amount of fuel available for the ships that are not in compliance with the sulphur regulations, which is limited by the transport demand outside of the SECAs.
\begin{equation}
    tdnoneca_t \geq \sum_{\forall s \in SNE} \left( fa_{t,s} \cdot ts_{t,s}\right), \forall t \in T \label{eq:td_noneca}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Emission constraints}
\noindent Emission Budget: The CO$_2$e emission budget must be greater or equal to the total systems up- and downstream emissions.
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
    eb &\geq \sum_{\forall t \in T}\sum_{\forall s \in S}\left(EC_{t,s} + EM_{t,s} \right) \label{eq:co2ebudget}\\
    \intertext{s.t.}
    EC_{t,s} &= fa_{t,s} \cdot ec_{t,s}, \forall t \in T, \forall s \in S\\
    EM_{t,s} &= fa_{t,s} \cdot em_{t,s}, \forall t \in T, \forall s \in S
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
\par\noindent
Emission Target: Limits the CO$_2$e emissions from the selected year (2050) on-wards.
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\sum_{\forall s \in S} \left(EC_{T_0,s}+EM_{T_0,s}\right)}{\sum_{\forall s \in S} \left(EC_{t,s}+EM_{t,s}\right)} \cdot et \geq 1, \forall t \in T_{\geq \left(etyr-T_0\right)}
\end{equation}
\par\noindent
Global SOx Limit: From the year 2020 onwards the fuel amount of those ship types is set to zero, whose sulphur content exceeds the global sulphur limit and have no scrubber installed.
\begin{equation}
    fa_{t,s} = 0, \forall t \in T_{\geq slnonecayr-T_0}, \forall s \in SNG \label{eq:sox_global}
\end{equation}
\par\noindent
Tier: Sets the fuel amount to zero for ships not in compliance with the NOx regulations inside the EU-NECAs from 2021 onward.
\begin{equation}
   fa_{t,s} = 0, \forall t \in T_{\geq tlecayr-T_0},\forall s \in NT \label{eq:tier}
\end{equation}

\section{Results and Discussion}

% BAU compared to IMO, compared to REF

\autoref{fig:BAU} displays the fuel consumption and cumulative CO$_2$-equivalent emissions in the business as usual scenario (BAU). Although SOx- and NOx-restriction area applied, no major change in fuel usage can be detected. If no carbon budget is applied, scrubbers instead of fuel switch are the most cost-efficient solution. Applying the IMO goal to halve climate emissions of shipping in 2050 of the IMO does not lead to significant changes except a minor switch to biodiesel instead of heavy fuel oil (see \autoref{fig:IMO}). In comparison, the climate emission budget restriction in the reference scenario  results in a significant fuel switch: Mainly hydrogen in fuel cells and biodiesel with scrubber in internal combustion engines are chosen (see \autoref{fig:REF}). The comparison shows, that without any kind of climate emission restriction, the emissions are twice as high and the IMO plans do not have a significant impact.

% Demand variation - Cheapest?, Cost reduction bigger than transport reduction
% aus Tills Arbeit: Since transport demand declines over time, less investments are needed so that the system costs fall by 25 % to 15 billion EUR2016. These overall cost reductions are much greater than the entire transport demand reduction of 17 %. The faster the demand curves in Fig. 8.12 fall before it reaches the year of major investments into new fuel technologies, the greater this cost benefit would be.


% Cost variation: Methanol and Ammonia are close
Due to the high level of uncertainty of cost development of infrastructure, fuel and propulsion technology of different marine fuel options, a wide range of cost variations is applied to test for its effect on fuel composition. The results are summarised in \autoref{fig:costVariation}. Depending on the cost rate change of a specific fuel (x-axis), its share in the total fuel consumption from 2016-2050 (y-axis) changes significantly. The black dashed line at a cost rate change of zero represents the reference scenario. Already at a change of 10\% cost change rate (including fuel, technology and infrastructure costs), methanol and ammonia gain relevance, reaching a dominant role at a 20\% cost change rate.

% LNG is no option, LBG just if methane leakage phase out
For LBG, the development of the methane leakage problem is of outstanding importance. Under the assumption that methane leakage can be coped with until 2050 (dashed line), LBG is close to hydrogen, methanol and ammonia as choice to be the dominate fuel in 2050. Contrary to that, LNG would not only require a methane leakage phase out, but also a very favourable cost development to play a major role.

% BATW has to be decreased significantly, but the conditions applied were rather unfavorable for BATW.
Sailing cargo ships, driven by a combination of wind and electricity from batteries seem to only be cost efficient in case of very strong drops in costs. However, the influence factors have more dimensions than just the pure battery and ship costs. In this model, it is assumed that one third of the propulsion is done by electricity. For long distance cargo, that mainly has to use the engine for manoeuvring into and out of the harbour, the wind share and potentially additional solar input can be significantly increased and thus the required battery and electricity costs reduced.

% Compare all scenarios: Fuel composition total and 2050
For comparison, the total fuel use of all scenarios for 2016-2050 is displayed in \autoref{fig:AllFuelTotal.pdf} and the fuel composition in the target year 2050 in \autoref{fig:AllFuel2050}. A general efficiency increase can be seen for all carbon budget scenarios. Due to higher efficiencies and thus a higher Tkm/GJfuel - rate, less fuel is applied in the carbon budget scenarios. Except the transport demand scenario all supply the same transport demand.

% Compare all scenarios: Costs - not sure if there should be a figure - maybe rather include the full table of results

% Costs - resulting EURO/CO$_2$e
Derived from the cost differences for fuel, ship and infrastructure, a carbon price in the range of 350--450 \euro(2016)/ton CO$_2$e would be required for a renewable transition of the Danish shipping sector. [Rau17, p. 198] TODO:insert citation - reports similar prices of around 430 \euro(2013)/ton CO$_2$e for a global transition.

% Costs - what does that mean for the cargo cost

Discussion:
\begin{itemize}
	\item other decisive factors than costs
	\item mitigation costs or mitigation gains
	\item weaknesses and strengths of the model
	\item applicability of the model on other countries
	\item applicability of the findings for the world shipping
	\item some kind of recommendations?

\section{Conclusion}
% 250 words
% only draft until now!
The achievement of CO$_2$-neutrality in the shipping sector is of great importance for reaching the targets of the Paris Agreement. Although this goal is underrepresented in the current discussion, this study shows, that it is possible for the Danish part of international shipping to become CO$_2$-neutral until 2050 with existing technologies. Regarding fuels, Hydrogen, methanol and ammonia are from a socio-economic cost perspective the most compatible. Due to high uncertainties regarding future cost developments and safety requirements (esp. ammonia), there is no clear winner. Regarding technologies, fuel cells are chosen for these fuel options, the decisive parameter being the higher fuel efficiency. Although LNG is the fuel option most prominently discussed as an alternative today, it would one have a short window of opportunity, mainly because of leakage problems of methane causing high greenhouse gas emissions. If this gaseous fuel is based on renewable sources, the so-called LBG can only play a role if methane leakage can be drastically reduced until 2050. The option of cargo-ships driven by a mixture of wind and electricity stored in batteries could not adequately be represented in the model setting. Their role would need a further refinement of the calculations.
%Although additional conditions for the future application of fuel for shipping like safety issues or infrastructure decisions are not reflected in the model, ...
The presented modelling approach indicates that either strong regulative carbon budgets or a carbon price of 350--450 \euro/t~CO$_2$ would be required to induce the necessary changes for a carbon neutral Danish shipping in 2050. This would double today's average cargo transport costs. However, due to the low share of transport cost on the value of transported goods, the average transported good would only increase by 6\% on average. This can be considered as the upper limit, since new fuel possibilities not reflected in this study might evolve.
