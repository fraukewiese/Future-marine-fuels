\section{Introduction}
% 1000
% The journal covers research in mechanical engineering and thermal sciences, with a strong focus on energy analysis, energy modelling and prediction, integrated energy systems, energy planning and energy management.

% What is required from the climate side and what does the IMO suggest so far
The ambition to reach climate pathways with limited overshoot of 1.5~\degree C requires global net zero CO$_2$ emissions by 2050 \cite{IPCC2018}. This implies a massive reduction of fossil fuels in the energy system. Several studies based on energy system models have shown possible pathways to net zero emissions for the electricity supply from country to continents and the whole world (TODO:references) and also for the heat sector. Although transport is more challenging (TODO:cite), in recent years an increasing amount of studies also includes pathways for this sector to net zero emissions in 2050 (TODO:cite). Though, the majority of scenarios leaves out a significant part of the transport emissions, namely international shipping (TODO:CITE?). Due to its international nature, appropriate governance is challenging \cite{GRITSENKO2017}. So far, countries leave out international shipping in their energy and climate plans, leaving the responsibility to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). While -- to some extent -- progress has been made regarding sulphur emission reduction, their goal of at least 50\% reduction until 2050 of worldwide shipping \cite{IMO2018} is neither ambitious enough to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement, nor underpinned with measures and possible pathway descriptions \cite{Wan2018}.

% Concentration on sulphur etc. does not lead further, just concentrating on LNG is too shortsighted
While liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) has mainly been in the focus as an alternative marine fuel \cite{IMO2016a,DNVGL2015} due to its advantage regarding sulphur, NO$_x$ and particle emissions, its possibility to also reduce climate impact of shipping has increasingly be questioned \cite{BRYNOLF2014b}. This is on the one hand due to its limited CO$_2$ emission benefit compared to oil \cite{DNVGL2014}. On the other hand, the implications for greenhouse gases depend on how the natural gas is extracted, processed, distributed, and used \cite{THOMSON2015}. According to IEA \cite{IEA2017}, average global gas methane leakage rate is almost 2~\% for natural gas. Looking at a global warming potential over a 20-year time frame, a leakage rate of 3-4~\% would already use up the climate benefit of natural gas compared to coal, over a 100-year time frame 6-7~\%. \citep{Hagos2018} states that a 1~\% methane slip from a dedicated LNG passenger vessel results, on average, in 8.5~\% increase in net GHG emissions. According to measurements and calculations based on \cite{Corbett2015,Stenersen2017}, methane slip of dual-fuel engines amounted to roughly 4~\% and of dedicated gas engines to 2.3~\% in 2016. Although LNG-specialised engines with high pressure direct injection could could lower leakage rates even further, ship owners today prefer dual-fuel engines as they judge flexibility and the resale value of the ship more important than efficiency gains because climate impact is not reflected in any economic value for shipping. 
In summary, the climate impact of both, LNG and methanol produced from natural gas is on the same order of magnitude as with use of heavy fuel oil \cite{BRYNOLF2014,DNVGL2018}. 
Independent of the role of LNG, one can generally conclude, that the current concentration on reduction of sulphur, NO$_x$ and particle emissions in shipping is too short-sighted \cite{Gilbert2014}, since climate emissions from shipping are the bigger challenge \cite{FRIDELL2019}. More radical changes avoiding infrastructure lock-ins and exploring co-benefits of sulphur and carbon reduction are advisable.

% So, what else than LNG could one do? - Some studies with different fuels in the focus
In line with that, the discussion about climate and other emission compatible future marine fuels has gained momentum in recent years. Indirect electrification via hydrogen or other synthetic fuels could be a promising option \cite{HORVATH2018} if relying on decarbonised inputs as well as bio-derived fuels under circumstances related to its scarcity \cite{Gilbert2014}. Also wind-energy in form of soft-sails, fixed-sails, Flettner Rotors or kite sails are options tested \cite{IRENA2015}.
% Specifically on hydrogen \cite{Raucci2017}. And methanol \cite{IMO2016b} with one big ferry already driving on it.

% and studies with other measures to reduce emissions
Another important aspect of reducing emissions additionally to fuel switch is energy efficiency measures, which are not completely exploited yet \cite{JAFARZADEH2014,CHI2018} and could be further improved applying e.g. waste heat recovery \cite{Baldi2015}. Furthermore, operational measures like slow steaming \cite{ARMSTRONG2013}, hull design and larger vessels \cite{LINDSTAD2015} can provide significant contributions to lowering emissions in shipping. However, as \cite{Olmer2017} show, shipping will need to move beyond energy efficiency interventions alone to achieve absolute emission reductions.

% But operational measures are not enough, we need a mixture.
Calculating different pathways until 2050, \cite{LloydsRegister2016} come to the conclusion, that different options are possible, mostly depending on the availability of biomass, the development of transport demand and technology learning, but in dependant of the pathway, all require a substitute for fossil fuel, operational measures are not sufficient. A meta-study looking at measures and fuels of various studies \cite{Bouman2017}, comes to the conclusion that a  75\% emission reduction is possible until 2050, but only with combination of measures. Looking at possible reduction targets, \cite{Smith2016} describe the pathway to zero emissions in 2035 in their most ambitious scenario. There is also an initiative from the shipping industry itself, striving for zero emission vessels \cite{SSI2018}, also worked on by Lloyd Register \cite{LloydsRegister2017}. 

% some studies rather for specific technologies, or on local level
Additionally to studies taking the meta-perspective, there is ongoing research about specific applications, like e.g. batteries in offshore support vessels \cite{Lindstad2017}, specific fuel options, like e.g. slow steaming and wind propulsion \cite{MANDER2017} or specific areas like emission reduction in port \cite{WINNES2015}.
% maybe add or for e.g. electric ferries in Denmark (TODO:cite)

% Regulation
Looking at the regulative side, \cite{SHI2016} suggests a scheme of market-based measures that can be adopted by means of an international convention under the auspices of the IMO and the UNFCCC. This could be a global emission trading scheme including shipping and aviation \cite{Dessens2014}, while \cite{GRITSENKO2017} suggests polycentric governance \cite{},

% Why it is so bad that shipping is underrepresented in the current discussion
Although at least in the scientific discussion, the technical, economical and regulative options for shipping to take its share in the climate responsibility has risen, it is still under-represented in current discussions and studies assessing energy transformation, regarding its importance and urgency. Its importance is due to (1) the general efficiency of shipping compared to other means of transport (TODO:citeAndNumber), (2) large share in worldwide transported goods (TODO:number and cite) and (3) wide range of transport demand predictions. According to the upper bound of predictions future cargo transport demand would increase by (TODO:citeAndNumber), which would heavily increase emissions as well. However, other predictions even assume a decrease in transport demand due to less fossil fuel transported, as well as increased circular economy and effects from 3D-printing (TODO:cite).

The urgency is due to (1) very long investment cycles of ships. This leads to the situation that decisions about the fuels to reach net zero emissions in 2050 are just around the corner. (2) Infrastructure requirements being essential and (3) the increasing interdependence between fuels applied in shipping and our land-based energy systems (electricity, heat, fuels for transport). Developments in shipping fuels will affect decisions on energy infrastructure on land and vice versa. Examples are refineries providing fuels for shipping but also land-based heavy transport, producing excess heat during the fuel production. Thus, options have to be intensively looked at and also optimised in combination with the rest of the energy system. 
% Maybe add example biomass scarcity - where to use the scarce biomass best?

% Which gap does this paper close?
% closing gap between international and local studies
This paper contributes to fill the gap between studies on inland shipping  with a high level of detail but limited scope and international shipping in low resolution regarding technology- and fuels. Our modelling approach takes emissions from international shipping into account but can be applied for single or several countries. It could thus be integrated in national energy and climate modelling scopes. Although we exemplary model Danish shipping, the methodology could be applied to other countries as well.
% taking the different costs and emissions into account
Unlike most other studies, data and model not only include costs for fuels and technologies but also infrastructure costs. Emission-wise, the whole picture is covered by taking well-to-propeller climate emissions including methane leakage into account while complying with current and future sulphur, NO$_x$ and particle emission restrictions.
% Several scenarios and threshold analysis regarding technology, fuel and infrastructure costs
In this holistic approach, today's and possible alternative fuels and technologies are evaluated against each other by an optimisation model, minimising total system costs while reaching net zero emissions in 2050. Due to high uncertainty regarding cost development, we perform a threshold analysis providing an overview of fuels-technology combinations likely to play a role in the future.

% What the reader can expect
In \autoref{sec:Methods}, we describe the mathematical formulation (\autoref{subsec:Mat}), data sources and processing (\autoref{subsec:Dat})and give and explain our scenario approach (\autoref{subsec:Sce}. Subsequently, we present the scenario and threshold analysis results and discuss their relevance, also describing strengths and weaknesses of the model approach (\autoref{sec:Results} and finally conclude (\autoref{sec:Conclusion}).

\subsection{Mathematical Formulation}
\label{subsec:Mat}
The future marine fuels problem is formulated mathematically as a linear and divisible model with the following equations. It is a stock model, initialised with data for the first time step that allows for investments in new technologies in the further course. The investment options are on the one hand forced and on the other limited by the model constraints. They are in general used to give credit to regularities and behaviour patterns that shape the system under investigation. Since the objective's sense is the minimisation of the overall system's costs \cref{eq:objective}, investments are interpreted as adverse but inevitable actions to cope with the constraint's demands, such as: Lowering CO$_2$e emissions to air, (over-)supplying the transport demand in each time-step or scrapping ships, when their lifetime is expired. The domains of all model variables are within non-negative real numbers, including zero $\left(R_{0}^{+}\right)$.

The nomenclature used in the constraints in the following sections is given in the nomenclature list.

\subsubsection{Objective function}
\noindent The model's objective is the minimisation of the total system costs. It comprises the sum of all accumulated annual costs for fuel, infrastructure and ships. Asset costs account only with the annual added amounts and are multiplied with their respective lifetimes, since they are given to the model as annuities.
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        min. &\sum_{\forall t \in T}\sum_{\forall s \in S}\left( CF_{t, s} + CI_{t, s} + CS_{t, s} \right)\label{eq:objective}\\
        \intertext{s.t.}
        CF_{t, s} &\geq fa_{t,s} \cdot cf_{t,s}\\
        CI_{t, s} &\geq \left( faiup_{t,s} - fainit_{t, s} \right) \cdot li_{s} \cdot ci_{t,s}, \forall t \in T_0\\
        CI_{t, s} &\geq faiup_{t,s} \cdot li_{s} \cdot ci_{t,s}, \forall t \in T_{>0}\\
        CS_{t, s} &\geq \left( fasup_{t,s} - fainit_{t, s} \right) \cdot ls_{s} \cdot cs_{t,s}, \forall t \in T_0\\
        CS_{t, s} &\geq fasup_{t,s} \cdot ls_{s} \cdot cs_{t,s}, \forall t \in T_{>0}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

\subsubsection{Fuel constraints}
\noindent The following fuel constraints refer to the amounts of fuel per ship type in each time step. Investments in infrastructure, new-build and refit ships consider exclusively the sum of the added capacities per ship or infrastructure over the respective lifetime. Ships and infrastructure are separated, due to different costs and lifetimes, even if they belong to the same technology.
\\
Infrastructure Capacity: Sum of all added infrastructure capacity within the respective proceeded technical lifetime.
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        faicap_{t,s} &\leq \sum_{\textbf{x}}^{t-1} \left( faiup_{x,s} \right), \forall t \in T_{>0}, \forall s \in S\label{eq:faicap}\\
        \intertext{s.t.}
        x &= T_0, \forall t \leq \left(li_{s} + T_0 - 1\right)\\
        x &= t - li_{s} + 1, \forall t > \left(li_{s} + T_0 - 1\right)
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
\par\noindent
Additional Infrastructure: Annual additional infrastructure capacity needed to supply the corresponding ship-types.
\begin{equation}
    faiup_{t,s} \geq fa_{t,s} - faicap_{t,s}, \forall t \in T_{>0}, \forall s \in S\label{eq:faiup}
\end{equation}
Ship Capacity: Sum of all added ships within the respective proceeded technical lifetime.
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        fascap_{t,s} &\leq \sum_{\textbf{x}}^{t-1} \left(fasup_{x,s} \right), \forall t \in T_{>0}, \forall s \in S\label{eq:fascap}\\
        \intertext{s.t.}
        x &= T_0, \forall t \leq \left(ls_{s} + T_0 - 1\right)\\
        x &= t - ls_{s} + 1, \forall t > \left(ls_{s} + T_0 - 1\right)
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Added Ships: Annual additional ship capacity needed to satisfy the transport demand.
\begin{equation}
    fasup_{t,s} \geq fa_{t,s} - fascap_{t,s}, \forall t \in T_{>0}, \forall s \in S\label{eq:fasup}
\end{equation}
Refit: Defines in each time-step the fuel amount available for refit by old ships.
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:refitships}
    \begin{align}
    fa_{t,s} + fa_{t,r} - fa_{T_0, s} &\leq 0, \forall t \in T_{<\left(T_0+ls_{s}\right)}, \forall s, r \in RO\\
    fa_{t,s} + fa_{t,r} & = 0, \forall t \in T_{\geq\left(T_0+ls_{s}\right)}, \forall s, r \in RO
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Bio-fuel: Limits the bio-fuel availability in each time step.
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{\forall s \in SB} \left(fa_{t,s} \right) - ba_{t} \leq 0, \forall t \in T\label{eq:biofuel}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Demand constraints}
\noindent Transport Demand: The transport supply of all ships must either be greater or equal to the transport demand in each time-step.
\begin{equation}
    tdtotal_t \leq \sum_{\forall s \in S} \left( fa_{t,s} \cdot ts_{t,s}\right), \forall t \in T \label{eq:td_total}
\end{equation}
Short Transport Demand: The amount of fuel available for short range ships is limited by the transport demand of that range.
\begin{equation}
    tdshort_t \geq \sum_{\forall s \in SR} \left( fa_{t,s} \cdot ts_{t,s}\right), \forall t \in T \label{eq:td_short}
\end{equation}
Non-SECAs Transport Demand: The amount of fuel available for the ships that are not in compliance with the sulphur regulations, which is limited by the transport demand outside of the SECAs.
\begin{equation}
    tdnoneca_t \geq \sum_{\forall s \in SNE} \left( fa_{t,s} \cdot ts_{t,s}\right), \forall t \in T \label{eq:td_noneca}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Emission constraints}
\noindent Emission Budget: The CO$_2$e emission budget must be greater or equal to the total systems up- and downstream emissions.
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
    eb &\geq \sum_{\forall t \in T}\sum_{\forall s \in S}\left(EC_{t,s} + EM_{t,s} \right) \label{eq:co2ebudget}\\
    \intertext{s.t.}
    EC_{t,s} &= fa_{t,s} \cdot ec_{t,s}, \forall t \in T, \forall s \in S\\
    EM_{t,s} &= fa_{t,s} \cdot em_{t,s}, \forall t \in T, \forall s \in S
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
\par\noindent
Emission Target: Limits the CO$_2$e emissions from the selected year (2050) on-wards.
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\sum_{\forall s \in S} \left(EC_{T_0,s}+EM_{T_0,s}\right)}{\sum_{\forall s \in S} \left(EC_{t,s}+EM_{t,s}\right)} \cdot et \geq 1, \forall t \in T_{\geq \left(etyr-T_0\right)}
\end{equation}
\par\noindent
Global SOx Limit: From the year 2020 onwards the fuel amount of those ship types is set to zero, whose sulphur content exceeds the global sulphur limit and have no scrubber installed.
\begin{equation}
    fa_{t,s} = 0, \forall t \in T_{\geq slnonecayr-T_0}, \forall s \in SNG \label{eq:sox_global}
\end{equation}
\par\noindent
Tier: Sets the fuel amount to zero for ships not in compliance with the NOx regulations inside the EU-NECAs from 2021 onward.
\begin{equation}
   fa_{t,s} = 0, \forall t \in T_{\geq tlecayr-T_0},\forall s \in NT \label{eq:tier}
\end{equation}

% BAU compared to IMO, compared to REF

\autoref{fig:BAU} displays the fuel consumption and cumulative CO$_2$-equivalent emissions in the business as usual scenario (BAU). Although SOx- and NOx-restriction area applied, no major change in fuel usage can be detected. If no carbon budget is applied, scrubbers instead of fuel switch are the most cost-efficient solution. Applying the IMO goal to halve climate emissions of shipping in 2050 of the IMO does not lead to significant changes except a minor switch to biodiesel instead of heavy fuel oil (see \autoref{fig:IMO}). In comparison, the climate emission budget restriction in the reference scenario  results in a significant fuel switch: Mainly hydrogen in fuel cells and biodiesel with scrubber in internal combustion engines are chosen (see \autoref{fig:REF}). The comparison shows, that without any kind of climate emission restriction, the emissions are twice as high and the IMO plans do not have a significant impact.

% Demand variation - Cheapest?, Cost reduction bigger than transport reduction
% aus Tills Arbeit: Since transport demand declines over time, less investments are needed so that the system costs fall by 25 % to 15 billion EUR2016. These overall cost reductions are much greater than the entire transport demand reduction of 17 %. The faster the demand curves in Fig. 8.12 fall before it reaches the year of major investments into new fuel technologies, the greater this cost benefit would be.


% Cost variation: Methanol and Ammonia are close
Due to the high level of uncertainty of cost development of infrastructure, fuel and propulsion technology of different marine fuel options, a wide range of cost variations is applied to test for its effect on fuel composition. The results are summarised in \autoref{fig:costVariation}. Depending on the cost rate change of a specific fuel technology (x-axis), while keeping all other parameters constant, its share in the total fuel consumption from 2016-2050 (y-axis) changes significantly. The black dashed line at a cost rate change of zero represents the reference scenario. Already at a 10\% cost change rate (including fuel, technology and infrastructure costs), methanol and ammonia respectively gain relevance, reaching a dominant role at a 20\% cost change rate. Thus if the costs of either methanol or ammonia drop by 20\%, these would take over the role of hydrogen as the main renewable fuel of the future.

% LNG is no option, LBG just if methane leakage phase out
For LBG, the development of the methane leakage problem is of outstanding importance. Under the assumption that methane leakage can be coped with until 2050 (dashed line), LBG is close to hydrogen, methanol and ammonia as choice to be the dominate fuel in 2050. Contrary to that, LNG would not only require a methane leakage phase out, but also a very favourable cost development to play a major role.

% BATW has to be decreased significantly, but the conditions applied were rather unfavorable for BATW.
Sailing cargo ships, driven by a combination of wind and electricity from batteries seem to only be cost efficient in case of very strong drops in costs. However, the influence factors have more dimensions than just the pure battery and ship costs. In this model, it is assumed that one third of the propulsion is done by electricity. For long distance cargo, that mainly has to use the engine for manoeuvring into and out of the harbour, the wind share and potentially additional solar input can be significantly increased and thus the required battery and electricity costs reduced.

% Compare all scenarios: Fuel composition total and 2050
For comparison, the total fuel use of all scenarios for 2016-2050 is displayed in \autoref{fig:AllFuelTotal} and the fuel composition in the target year 2050 in \autoref{fig:AllFuel2050}. A general efficiency increase can be seen for all carbon budget scenarios. Due to higher operational tank-to-propeller efficiency and thus a higher Tkm/GJfuel - rate, less fuel is applied in the carbon budget scenarios. Except the transport demand scenario all supply the same transport demand.

% Compare all scenarios: Costs - not sure if there should be a figure - maybe rather include the full table of results

% Costs - resulting EURO/CO$_2$e
Derived from the cost differences for fuel, ship and infrastructure, a carbon price in the range of 350--450 \euro(2016)/ton CO$_2$e would be required for a renewable transition of the Danish shipping sector. \citep[p.197]{Raucci2017} reports similar prices of around 430 \$(2013)/ton CO$_2$ for a global transition.

% applicability of the model on other countries
% applicability of the findings for the world shipping
The model code and most of the data references and pre-processing can also be applied for other countries, especially Europe. However, since shipping has a global perspective, the case study for Denmark already gives a good indication of the fuel shares chosen for a cost-optimal path to carbon neutrality in 2050 for the worldwide shipping. Conditions for shipping are similar, the basic parameters, technology, fuel and infrastructure costs are considered as world prices rather than reflecting local particularities. This is also reflected and validated by the similar CO$_2$e-cost range compared to other, worldwide studies. 

% Why the mentioned costs are rather the upper end
Compared to other sectors like electricity and heat, these mitigation costs per /ton CO$_2$e seem high, one has to consider several points. First, this is the upper bound of cost: Technologies considered are all applicable today, developments in other sectors applying similar fuel switch options could further increase costs, additional alternatives could evolve. Second, as shown in the demand reduction scenarios, any decrease in transport demand would save costs even beyond the proportional saving. This is due to not only fuel savings (proportional) but, also due avoided investments in new ships (disproportionate). And third, refits and hybrid solutions have not been considered to a great extent in the model functionality and could further decrease costs and ease the shift to different fuels.

% Costs - what does that mean for the cargo cost

% Co-benefits.
Thus, costs could get lower for the transition, but the question is also whether to talk about mitigation costs. Co-benefits like reduced air pollution have not been quantified on a monetary basis in the model and were this not part of the optimisation. However, these could have essential health benefits, maybe even reaching mitigation gains instead of mitigation costs.

% Regulation / Recommendations
The necessary transition will not happen under current market conditions. Regulation is required urgently to bring shipping on the pathway to carbon neutrality in 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement. A carbon budget for shipping worldwide, broken down to countries is a viable option to consider. Additionally research money for alternative fuels and technologies, as well as solving crucial questions on security, infrastructure and methane leakage issues are important contributions to implement the transition to climate neutral shipping in 2050.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
% 250 words
% only draft until now!
The achievement of CO$_2$-neutrality in the shipping sector is of great importance for reaching the targets of the Paris Agreement. Although this goal is underrepresented in the current discussion, this study shows, that it is possible for the Danish part of international shipping to become CO$_2$-neutral until 2050 with existing technologies. Regarding fuels, hydrogen, methanol and ammonia are from a socio-economic cost perspective the most compatible. Due to high uncertainties regarding future cost developments and safety requirements (esp. ammonia), there is no clear winner. Regarding technologies, fuel cells are chosen for these fuel options, the decisive parameter being the higher fuel efficiency. Although LNG is the fuel option most prominently discussed as an alternative today, it would only have a short window of opportunity, mainly because of leakage problems of methane causing high greenhouse gas emissions as well as high fuel and technology costs. If this gaseous fuel is based on renewable sources, the so-called LBG can only play a role if methane leakage can be drastically reduced until 2050. The option of cargo-ships driven by a mixture of wind and electricity stored in batteries could not adequately be represented in the model setting. The evaluation of their role would need a further refinement of the calculations.
%Although additional conditions for the future application of fuel for shipping like safety issues or infrastructure decisions are not reflected in the model, ...
The presented modelling approach indicates that either strong regulative carbon budgets or a carbon price of 350--450 \euro/t~CO$_2$e would be required to induce the necessary changes for a carbon neutral Danish shipping in 2050. This would double today's average cargo transport costs. However, due to the low share of transport cost on the value of transported goods, the average transported good would only increase by 6\% on average. This can be considered as the upper limit, since new fuel possibilities not reflected in this study might evolve.
